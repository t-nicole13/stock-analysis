## Overview of Project 
The purpose of this project was to refractor the code that was created in the module 2.   We want to improve the design of the code without changing the output once the coded is run.  The code in module 2 and the refractored code should yield the same output.  <br/>


## Results

For 2018, my refractored code output did not match the output in the original code.  However, my output for 2017 was the same for both the refractored and original code.  I do not understand how this is possible and after reviewing my code I could not figure out the issue.  I didn't want to mess with my code again because I wanted to avoid a weird overflow error that I kept receiving earlier.  

Based on the results I received, the return for ENPH is decreased from 2017 to 2018.
